As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered, or deflected, in all directions by molecules and small particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky."}],"stop_generation":0,"__lastAccess":1703611086395,"abort_flag":0}
